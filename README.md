# Workshop-2017-06

With the support of the [XML London](http://xmllondon.com/)
organizers, space has been obtained for a one day XProc Workshop on
14 June 2017 in London, UK.

Please use the [Wiki](https://github.com/xproc/Workshop-2017-06/wiki)
in this repository to collect fodder for the workshop.

If you would like to be invited to the project so that you can edit the
wiki, please contact [Norm](mailto:ndw@nwalsh.com).
